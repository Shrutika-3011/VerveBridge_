# Predictive Maintenance System using IoT Sensor Data

## Overview
This project implements a predictive maintenance system that forecasts equipment failures using IoT sensor data. By leveraging machine learning models, it predicts when maintenance is required, helping to reduce downtime and optimize maintenance schedules.

## Key Features
- Predictive models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LSTM) to forecast equipment failure.
- Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest.
- Real-time monitoring with alerts.
- Cost-benefit analysis comparing predictive and traditional maintenance methods.
